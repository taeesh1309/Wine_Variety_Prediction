# Wine Variety Prediction

## Description
This project utilizes the Wine Reviews dataset, focusing on wines from the United States. It aims to explore feature engineering, classification, and regression analysis techniques. The dataset is analyzed for patterns, correlations, and trends, with specific attention to wine varieties as the primary target variable. Various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, and Neural Networks, are applied to classify wine varieties based on their characteristics. The project also delves into regression analysis to predict continuous numerical features and concludes with recommendations based on the classifiers' performance.
